# Simple-React-Calculator

Practicing/Learning react and creating a simple calculator using react elements.

CSS Styling borrowed heavily from 'Web Dev Simplified' on YouTube from the tutorial: 'The Perfect Beginner React Project'.

However, the core functionality is my own and was built by me alone. I did not follow the tutorial for the rest of the project.

This program uses React as the core framework and the useState hook in order to update the display on the top. onClick listeners are added to each individual button which updates the displays accordingly.

The actual math is evaluated using JavaScript's eval() function. Therefore the calculator does not exhaustively consider all the edge cases that may occur. However for a simple application/demonstration I deemed that this was sufficient as this meant to focus on the front css and react components not the actual math logic.
